# CleanSight
## Problem Statement 
Tourist spots at inaccessible areas are very inefficient to clean. One of the main issue being Fuel Expensive and spotting out the garbage which can eventually lead to natural calamity like Landslides due to soil erosion
## Our Solution 
We created a software cum hardware solution that takes visual insights through a UAV(Unmanned aerial vehicle) and detects inorganic trash pileups to send the geolocation to the software that generates a comprehensive geolocation heatmap.
